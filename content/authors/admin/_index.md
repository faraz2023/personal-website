I am a PhD student in the Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto. My current research focuses on large-scale pandemic modeling and the intersection of graph neural networks and reinforcement learning. I have implemented novel machine learning applications for the early prognosis of COVID-19 patients during my MASc program (2020-21) and before fast-tracking to the PhD program.

I received my BSc in philosophy, computer science, and statistics from the University of Toronto (2020), where I won Woodsworth College Brookfield’s Leadership Scholarship award (2018) and Scholars in Residence award (2017), and participated in the Socrates project at the Department of Philosophy (2018).
